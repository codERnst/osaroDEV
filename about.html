        <p>Brief</p><br>
        <p>I have always found joy in building stuff. For as long as I can remember, during my free time you could find me studying, researching, playing chess or just using my hands in some way. The sense of achievement you feel after seeing the finished product of something you have made never ceases to amaze me. I registered to learn programming more than a decade ago but university education called; hence I had to abort mission to sudy Chemical Engineering. Fast forward to October, 2019, I decided to learn programming. I was instantly hooked. It felt like I had found my purpose. I am overjoyed to have created a life where I get to build amazing things for others to use and enjoy.
